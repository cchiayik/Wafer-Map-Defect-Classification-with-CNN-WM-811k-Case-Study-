# 🧠 Wafer Map Defect Classification with CNN (WM-811k Case Study)
# 📌 Project Overview

This project explores the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for semiconductor wafer defect pattern classification using the WM-811k dataset.

Defect pattern recognition is critical in semiconductor manufacturing for improving yield analysis and fault detection. By leveraging deep learning, we aim to automatically classify wafer maps into multiple defect categories, reducing reliance on manual inspection.

##⚡ Key Features

Built with TensorFlow/Keras in Python (experimented on Kaggle).

Implemented two experimental pipelines:

Standard Train/Validation split

K-Fold Cross Validation for robustness

Applied class balancing strategies (weighted loss, smoothing) to address dataset imbalance.

Achieved ~85% validation accuracy with strong generalization performance.

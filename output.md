## Confusion Matrix Analysis

The confusion matrix provides deeper insight into class-level performance:

High Accuracy Classes:

Edge-Ring and Edge-Loc show strong classification results, with the majority of samples correctly identified.

Center and Loc classes also perform well, though some misclassifications occur.

Challenging Cases:

Random and Scratch classes exhibit confusion with other categories, likely due to visual similarities in wafer defect patterns.

The Near-Full category has very few samples, making it prone to misclassification and under-representation.

Key Takeaway: While the model performs well overall, minor classes with fewer samples are more error-prone. Future work could explore data augmentation or class rebalancing techniques to further enhance classification robustness.
